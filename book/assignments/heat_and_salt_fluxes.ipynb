    "Let's assume that initially the ocean and atmosphere are in a balanced state, with no turbulent heat exchange and $T = T_{10} = 20^\\circ$C. Suddenly a cold front comes through and the air temperature drops suddenly to 18$^\\circ$C. Assume there is no ocean current and that the atmospheric winds are blowing at 10 m/s. You can also assume that $C_H = 10^{-3}$.\n",

    "1. Assume the mixed layer is 50 m deep. Calculate the instantaneous rate of mixed layer cooling immediately after the drop in air temperature. Express your answer in degrees per day.\n",
    "1. This cooling rate cannot be maintained.\n",
    "   As the mixed layer cools and the ocean temperature approaches the air temperature, the sensible heat flux will become weaker. \n",
    "   Derive an equation describing the time evolution of the air-sea temperature difference $T' = T - T_{10}$, assuming $T_{10}$ remains fixed.\n",
    "   ($T'$ is positive when the water is warmer than the air.) You should find an equation of the form $\n",
    " \\frac{dT'}{dt} = - \\lambda T' $.\n",
    "   The constant $\\lambda$ is an inverse timescale. Express $\\lambda$ first in terms of the other parameters and then find its value. Give your answer in the units days$^{-1}$. In your own words, what does $\\lambda$ represent? How does it depend on the mixed layer depth? The wind speed?\n",
    "1. This equation is a simple linear, first-order ordinary differential equation. Write the solution for $T'(t)$. How long does it take the initial air-sea difference of 2$^\\circ$C to be reduced by half?"
