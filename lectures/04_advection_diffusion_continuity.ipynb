For this reason, we will mostly talk about heat transport in situations where the total ocean mass, or the mass of an individual basin under consideration, is constant in time (i.e. $d M / d t = 0$).

However, upon adding these terms together, we see that the terms proportional to $\\Theta_{ref}$ cancel, because $F_m^{side} + F_m^{surf} = 0$. This observation tells us that we can only assess the contribution of the circulation to the heat budget for _circulations that conserve mass_. Attempting to break down this contribution into a sum of different components can lead to spurious conclusions, since these individual components potentially depend on an arbitrary reference temperature $\\Theta_{ref}$.\n"
